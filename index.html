    <h2>Weekend on the Seine</h2>

    <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>

    <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
    <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <strong>Montmartre</strong> right away. <br>Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <strong>la Seine.</strong></p>

    <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
    <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <strong>Avenue des Champs Elysees.</strong> Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br><br>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <strong>Notre Dame.</strong> We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. We also visited <strong>le Louvre.</strong></p>

    <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
    <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <strong>Arc de Triomphe.</strong> It's huge! We also went to <strong>le Musee D'Orsay.</strong> Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
